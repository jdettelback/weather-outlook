# Weather Outlook

## This application displays the five day forecast for a user-inputted city.  When the name of the city is entered, the date, temp, wind speed and humidity levels are displayed in the main panel.  Below that, the same information for the next 5 days is shown on individual cards.  An icon to correspond with the weather forecast is also displayed. 

## Prior searches are shown below the input area and can be clicked to show updated information from that city without retyping.
